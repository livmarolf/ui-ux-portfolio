              <h3>CONCEPT</h3>
              <p>
                The forthcoming process embodies my individual approach to UX
                design, one that I consistently apply to each UX project I take
                on. This design methodology has evolved and matured over time
                through my experience in the field.

              <p>
                User experience (UX) design is far from a single-step task,
                extending well beyond the act of simply opening a laptop and
                creating wireframes!

              <p>
                Creating a testing plan is essential for a practical evaluation
                of a UI/UX design. It sets clear goals, metrics, and resource
                allocations, ensuring a straightforward and systematic
                evaluation process. The plan addresses potential risks, guides
                feedback collection, and fosters collaboration, providing a
                solid basis for practical usability testing and ongoing
                improvement.

                Conducting user tests in user design means getting feedback from
                users to understand how well a product or interface works.
                Observing users interacting with the design helps identify
                issues or improvements. These insights guide practical
                adjustments, ensuring the design suits user preferences and
                behaviors.

                Reporting user testing findings means summarizing what users did
                and said to provide insights and recommendations for design
                improvements. A straightforward and clear report helps
                stakeholders understand user experience issues and make informed
                decisions in the design process.

              <p>
                After user testing, we tweak designs based on user feedback to
                make them more user-friendly and effective. This involves
                identifying and addressing specific issues to improve usability
                and align with user preferences. The goal is to refine the
                design through practical adjustments for a smoother user
                experience.

              Real estate agents face challenges in maintaining effective
              communication with clients. Traditional methods like phone calls
              and emails are often insufficient for meeting evolving client
              expectations. Agents must be accessible and provide personalized
              experiences. There's a growing demand for practical solutions to
              help agents navigate transactions while fostering client
              connections in a competitive industry.

            <p>
              Handling a constant stream of new clients poses a challenge.
              Agents must balance time management with ensuring each client
              feels valued. The shift to digital-first approaches requires
              rethinking client interactions. This emphasizes the importance of
              UI/UX design in simplifying workflows, enhancing accessibility,
              and improving client engagement in real estate.

            This website should help agents manage properties, communicate with

              My research plan involves talking to real estate agents through

              needs and challenges better. I'll also look at market trends and

              In real estate, digital tools play a big role. Almost all

              interesting that only 69% of agents have a website, showing
              there's room for more agents to go digital. Having an online
              presence is crucial, considering how many homebuyers rely on the
              internet to find their next home.

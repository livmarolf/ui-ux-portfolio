              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  6/6 participants communicated that transparency in
                  communication, especially concerning schedule changes, is an
                  area where improvements are needed
                </li>
                <li>
                  All teammates (3/6 interviewees) expressed interest in easily
                  tracking their training progress and the hours dedicated to
                  it, indicating a potential opportunity for better monitoring

                <li>
                  It was stated by all interviewees (6/6) that the methods used

                  email, team meetings, messaging apps, and digital calendars

                </li>
                <li>
                  2/6 interviewees have faced challenges in team management,
                  such as motivating players during losing streaks and handling

                With a good understanding of the audience, including their
                objectives and requirements, I use user personas to represent

              <h3>Product Goals</h3>

              <p>
                I've chosen to compile project goals that will serve as a
                roadmap for the future development of the product. These goals
                will also act as criteria for deciding which features to
                incorporate into the mobile application.
              </p>

              <p>
                These objectives blend user goals from my user persona with
                business goals based on all available information.

            <div>
              <p>
                Subsequently, I translated my brainstormed solutions into a
                detailed list of product features to construct a product
                roadmap. These features were categorized into four groups:
                Must-have (P1), Nice-to-Have (P2), and Extra (P3) features. The
                categorization was based on their alignment with both business
                and user objectives.
              </p>

              <p>
                The product roadmap not only aligns project goals with the
                product but also guarantees that we prioritize the most critical
                features during the development phase.

              Wireframes are a fundamental tool in design, serving as a
              blueprint that guides the development of user-friendly and
              efficient interfaces. Explore the HuddleUp wireframes below.

              After finishing the final prototype, I believe the initial design
              goals have been met. The mobile app prioritizes sports team
              management and player engagement. If more time were available, I'd
              work on adding extra features that, while not essential, could
              enhance the app's qualities, adding more value to the business and
              boosting its competitiveness.

                    2/6 interviewees have faced challenges in team management,

                  I've chosen to compile project goals that will serve as a

                  will also act as criteria for deciding which features to

                detailed list of product features to construct a comprehensive
                product roadmap. These features were categorized into four
                groups: Must-have (P1), Nice-to-Have (P2), and Surprising and
                Delightful (P3) features. The categorization was based on their
                alignment with both business and user objectives.
              </p>
              <p>
                The product roadmap not only aligns project goals with the

                features during the development phase.

                I developed the user task flow for the class check-in process, a
                pivotal functionality within the website. This task flow is
                designed to accommodate guest visitors seeking to enroll in a
                class.

                Wireframes are a fundamental tool in design, serving as a
                blueprint that guides the development of user-friendly and
                efficient interfaces. Explore the HuddleUp wireframes below.

              Upon the completion of the final prototype, I am confident that
              the goals established at the outset of the design process have
              been successfully attained. The mobile application I have crafted
              offers a range of features with a central focus on sports team
              management and enhancing player involvement.

            <p>
              Given additional time, I would invest further effort in the
              development of certain desirable, albeit non-essential, features.
              These enhancements would augment the application's attributes,
              contributing additional facets to the business and bolstering its
              competitiveness.
